    <h1>Heart Disease Prediction</h1>
    <h2>Problem Framing:</h2>
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>The goal of this analysis is to investigate the key factors associated with heart disease by utilizing the Heart Disease dataset from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 2022. Through the application of logistic regression, I aim to identify important variables that influence the likelihood of developing heart disease.</p>
    <h3>Key Questions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Which demographic and health-related factors are linked to heart disease risk?</li>
        <li>How do factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, diabetes, obesity, physical activity, and alcohol consumption affect the likelihood of heart disease?</li>
        <li>How is heart disease distributed across different demographic groups?</li>
        <li>Can patterns or correlations be detected between various variables and the prevalence of heart disease?</li>
        <li>Which machine learning algorithm provides the most accurate prediction of heart disease likelihood?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Exploration and Visualization:</h2>
    <h3>Data Understanding:</h3>
    <p>I explored the structure of the dataset and examined the various variables. During this process, I identified any missing data, outliers, or anomalies.</p>
    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h3>
    <p>I performed statistical analysis on key variables such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes, obesity, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. I visualized the distribution of these variables and examined how heart disease prevalence has changed over time. Additionally, I explored the relationships between heart disease and other variables.</p>
    <h3>Data Visualizations:</h3>
    <p>I used a variety of visual tools, including histograms, bar charts, and pie charts, to depict the distribution of variables. Time-series plots were created to analyze trends in heart disease prevalence over time. Heatmaps were utilized to investigate correlations between different variables, and geographical maps were developed to show regional variations, where applicable.</p>
    <h3>Insight Generation:</h3>
    <p>I identified key patterns and correlations within the data, offering insights into the most significant factors contributing to heart disease risk. The impact of various variables on heart disease prevalence was also explored.</p>
    <h3>Summaries and Reports:</h3>
    <p>I generated detailed summaries and reports that address the key questions and provide actionable insights. The reports also discuss the implications of the logistic regression model coefficients in predicting the likelihood of heart disease. This analysis aims to deepen the understanding of heart disease risk factors and contribute to the development of preventive healthcare measures and personalized treatment strategies.</p>
